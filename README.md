#### About

This app is discontinued. It evolved into [Musabeat](https://github.com/pedrogardim/musabeat).
<br/>

It's a web app with some music creation features, such as:
- Musical events scheduling
- Drum sequencer
- Chord progression composing interface
- Playback
- Offline bouncing

It's based on jQuery and ToneJS.

#### Code

As a disclaimer, this app is one of the first I developed, while learning web development on the fly. I'm aware the code is full of bad practices, such as many global variables, and it's very unreadable. (It made me hate imperative programming! 😮‍💨). 
<br/>
But as the app has some interesting features, and a interesting and minimalist UI, I decided to make this repository public. 
<br/>
Thanks for checking it out!
